## Installation

### Windows

- Clone this repository.
- Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 or later.
- Check [Nuget.config](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-asp-ui-template-gallery/blob/dev/NuGet.config). If DevExpress Local Nuget Feed is missing, get the key [here](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116042/nuget/obtain-your-nuget-feed-credentials#devexpresscom-online-nuget-feed-any-os) and update Nuget.config.
- Run the project (`F5`).

### Mac OS

- Clone this repository.
- Open the project folder in an IDE that supports `.NET` (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
- Get the key [here](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/116042/nuget/obtain-your-nuget-feed-credentials#devexpresscom-online-nuget-feed-any-os) and update [Nuget.config](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-asp-ui-template-gallery/blob/dev/NuGet.config).
- If .NET SDK is absent, download and install it first ([link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)).
- Run `dotnet run` in the terminal from the project root folder.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers:** Contains actions connected to Views.
- **Views:** Contains layout pages.
  - *Auth:* Authorization-related forms.
  - *Shared:* Root layout logic.
  - Other folders match the names of individual views.
- **Models:** Contains application data models.
- **DAL** and **Services:** Data processing logic.
- **Utils:** Helper methods for common tasks.
- **src:** Client-side code. This folder mirrors structure of views and layouts.

## Client-side libraries and build process

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) manages client libraries: [jQuery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) and [DevExtreme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devextreme).
- Styles are written in SCSS.
- Client logic is written in TypeScript.

Run `F5` to start MSBuild. It will execute the following build steps:

- Node.js check and NPM package restore.
- Required jQuery/DevExtreme assets (scripts, icons, fonts) copied from `node_modules` to `wwwroot` by `CopyTask`.
- SCSS files compiled to CSS by `AspNetCore.SassCompiler`. Output sent to `wwwroot`. You can change this configuration in `appsettings.json`.
- TypeScript compiled to JavaScript by `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild`. Results sent to `wwwroot`.

To include extra third-party client resources:

- Install the packages using NPM.
- Add assets to the [`CopyTask`](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-asp-ui-template-gallery/blob/eca6039179487322bdb682fa68558d34799ca9ec/devextreme-asp-ui-template-gallery.csproj#L18).

## Views

The application layout combines a top toolbar, left navigation menu, and the main content view.

- Navigation menu is grouped. If you click an item, the corresponding view loads in content area.
- Views may have unique style and script files for modularity and customization.

**Add TypeScript script to a view:**
- Create `myview.ts` in `src/ts/views`.
- Link the resulting `myview.js` file in the view markup. 

```html
<script src="~/js/views/myview.js"></script>
```

**Add SCSS to a view:**
- Create `myview.scss` in `src/scss/views`.
- Link the resulting `myview.css` file in the view markup.

```html
<link href="~/css/views/myview.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Navigation

### Custom Router

Navigation between views is handled by a custom router. It supports both full page reload and single-page dynamic updates.

### Navigation Logic

- **Layout Check**  
  - If **target view Layout differs** from the current view Layout, the router performs a **full page reload**.  
  - If **Layouts match**, the router **dynamically replaces only the content**, preserving header, footer, and navigation menu.

- **URL Handling**  
  - The router uses the [`pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) method and [`popstate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/popstate_event) event to modify and track browser history.  
  - When you navigate through pages, the router:
    1. Calls `pushState` to add the target URL.  
    2. Loads the target page content.  
    3. Compares the **Layout** of the current and target pages using custom `data-target-placeholder-id` attribute.  
    4. Updates only the content if Layouts match, otherwise reloads the page.  

For detailed implementation, refer to [router.ts](src/ts/router.ts).

### Layout management

- **Partial Updates**  
  - [`_LayoutPartial.cshtml`](Views/Shared/_LayoutPartial.cshtml) is used to send partial updates from the server.  
  - This logic is defined in [`_ViewStart.cshtml`](Views/_ViewStart.cshtml).

- **Authentication Views**  
  - The [`_ViewStart.cshtml`](Views/Auth/_ViewStart.cshtml) file includes additional Layout selection logic.  
  - Authentication views can be displayed either in the main Layout or a specific Layout displayed when users log out.

## Themes

The application supports [themes](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401270/devextreme-based-controls/concepts/themes) for a consistent look and feel across all views.

-	Themes are managed using SCSS variables defined in the [scss](src/scss) folder.
-	Themes can be [switched dynamically at runtime](https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/#Switch_Between_Themes_at_Runtime/Without_Page_Reload).
-	To customize or extend themes, modify the SCSS files in the `css` or `scss` directories.
-	The theme selection can be persisted for each user. For more details, refer to [theme.ts](src/ts/theme.ts).
-	To add a new theme, create a new SCSS file with your color and style overrides and include it in the build process.

## Data Access Layer (DAL)

The application uses Entity Framework Core to manage data.

- Data is fetched from the DevExpress remote data service and stored in a SQLite database file. For details, see [DemoDataFetcher.cs](DAL/DemoDataFetcher.cs).
- For demonstration purposes, a per-user cache is implemented: [SessionDbContextMiddleware.cs](Middleware/SessionDbContextMiddleware.cs).
- First-time user connection triggers SQLite to clone in server memory.
- Only the user accesses their database copy, which is erased after a period of inactivity to free memory.
- [LocalDemoDataContext](DAL/LocalDemoDataContext.cs) contains in-memory static data for demo purposes.
- [DemoDbContext](DAL/DemoDbContext.cs) lists entities used across views.
